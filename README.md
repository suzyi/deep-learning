#### depth-width tradeoff
+ Ronen Eldan and Ohad Shamir. The Power of Depth for Feedforward Neural Networks
+ [Raman Arora](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Home.html), Johns Hopkins University. Selected publications: [Understanding Deep Neural Networks with Rectified Linear Units - ICLR 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01491.pdf)
#### paper recommondation
These papers are among good quality. If only I could find a paper that has good quality once every ten days. No matter how, this requires broadly reading among plentful literatures and references therein.
+ (Sep 5, 2018. I found this paper from Quora, by the recommondation of the author himself.) [Understanding Deep Neural Networks with Rectified Linear Units - ICLR 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01491.pdf), aims at universal approximation, one-hidden-layer NN optimization of Relu network.
+ (Nov 1, 2018. I found this paper from the reference at the end of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06365)) [Deep Neural Networks as 0-1 Mixed Integer Linear Programs: A Feasibility Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06174). This paper aims at dead with the optimization problem of one-hidden-layer Relu NN using mixed integer programming (MIP). From this paper, I begin to know that MIP can be introduced into optimize Relu NN. Notice that solving integer programming exactly may take an exponential running time.
+ (Nov 14, 2018. Prof. Yuan recommend this paper to me, since one day I talk to him that the weights and biases in the final layer matters more and one can randomly initialize the weights and biases in other layer and then make a least square to calculate the weights in the final layer.) [Extreme learning machine: Theory and applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231206000385). This paper aims at universal approximation theory of one-hidden-layer NN with any kind of infinitely differentiable activation function. As I mentioned before at the begining of this paragraph, it gives an algorithm to train the single-hidden-layer NN. Main idea is, randomly initialize weights and biases and then make a least square for the weights that connects to the output layer. This paper follow a technique from [Capabilities of a Four-Layered Feedforward NN: 4 vs 3](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/557662)
+ (Dec 26, 2018) I am still not sure if it's a good idea or not that [A Tropical Approach to Neural Networks with Piecewise Linear Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08749) paper provides an innovative view of applying tropical geometry to Relu NN. This paper now (it's Dec 26, 2018) cited by only 1 paper.
+ (Dec 26, 2018) The paper "[ReLU Regression: Complexity, Exact and Approximation Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03592.pdf)", cited by 0 since posted on axiv.org (it's Dec 26, 2018) An auxiliary function method to eliminate the diffidulty of brute-forcely searching global optimality of single-hidden-layer Relu NN.
