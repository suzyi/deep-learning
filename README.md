## Recommendation
### deep learning courses
+ [EPFL course](https://documents.epfl.ch/users/f/fl/fleuret/www/dlc/#information). This is a deep learning course provided by senior researcher FRANÇOIS FLEURET [(His homepage)](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/), who is now an adjunct faculty in the School of Engineering of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.

#### scholars studying the theory of deep learning
+ [Shiyu Liang](https://www.shiyu-liang.com/), university of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Selected publications: [Why Deep Neural Network For Function Approximation? - ICLR 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04161)
+ [Raman Arora](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Home.html), assistant prof in John Hopkin univ. Selected papers: [Understanding deep neural networks with rectified linear units - ICLR 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01491).
+ [Ruoyu Sun](https://sites.google.com/site/ruoyusun88/home), assistant professor in UIUC, was a postdoctoral scholar with Prof. Yinyu Ye.
+ [Yuandong Tian](http://www.yuandong-tian.com/), a Facebook AI researcher, got his phd from CMU. There're many practical interesting applications (including "A Reimplementation of AlphaGoZero", "") shown in his personal home page.
