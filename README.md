## Recommendation
### deep learning courses
+ [EPFL course](https://documents.epfl.ch/users/f/fl/fleuret/www/dlc/#information). This is a deep learning course provided by senior researcher FRANÇOIS FLEURET [(His homepage)](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/), who is now an adjunct faculty in the School of Engineering of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.

scholars studying the theory of deep learning
+ [Shiyu Liang](https://www.shiyu-liang.com/), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Selected publications: [Why Deep Neural Network For Function Approximation? - ICLR 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04161)
+ [Raman Arora](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Home.html) Assistant prof in John Hopkin univ. Selected papers: Understanding deep neural networks with rectified linear units.
