## 1 - Recommendation
### 1 - 1 - deep learning courses
+ [EPFL course](https://documents.epfl.ch/users/f/fl/fleuret/www/dlc/#information). This is a deep learning course provided by senior researcher FRANÇOIS FLEURET [(His homepage)](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/), who is now an adjunct faculty in the School of Engineering of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.
### 1 - 2 - scholars studying the theory of deep learning
+ [Shiyu Liang](https://www.shiyu-liang.com/), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Selected publications: [Why Deep Neural Network For Function Approximation? - ICLR 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04161)
+ [Raman Arora](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Home.html), Johns Hopkins University. Selected publications: [Understanding Deep Neural Networks with Rectified Linear Units - ICLR 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01491.pdf)
